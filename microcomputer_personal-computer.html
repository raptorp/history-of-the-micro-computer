          <h3>The software operating system</h3>
          <p class="headline-sub">
            A contender to the microcomputer was IBM's so-called
            <em>Personal Computer</em> or <em>PC</em> although it was much
            pricier and did not find its way into normal homes straight away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Much began to change as the new IBM PC entered the market. The IBM
            PC used a software operating system. This had to load on startup but
            made it easier to update - simply because you did not need to buy a
            completely new piece of hardware. The
            <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> was called
            <cite>MSDOS</cite>, this was short for
            <cite>Micro-Soft Disk Operating System</cite> (yes, they used a dash
            in their name in the early days). The code was based on the
            <cite>UNIX</cite>
            operating system although greatly simplified.

            I can't remember a time where we didn't have a computer in my home -
            I can't even remember a time where I didn't have a
            computer/phone/gameboy on my person at all times, so I had to call
            up my mom to help. <br />
            My family got our first PC in 1997, when I was 3-years old. It was
            an <cite>IBM 340</cite> - one of the first "budget" models - and it
            probably saved my mom from endless hours of handwriting assignments
            for uni.
          </p>
          <p>
            My mom had the policy of always answering questions truthfully (no
            Tooth Fairy or Santa-lies here), so when 3-year-old me asked her
            what the big grey box on the desk was, she told me. That was a
            <em>big</em>
            mistake. Little did she know, that 3-year-old me had just discovered
            back-talk and that I was just about to develop a new unforeseen
            level of sass and attitude.

            After surviving the inquisition of a toddler and being proud that
            she fulfilled her motherly duties and broadened my horizon, she
            thought everything would go on as normal. Oh boy was she wrong.
            Afterwards when she asked 3-year-old me where something was I would
            respond with phrases like:
          </p>
          <q>I'll check the hard drive … hard drive is deleted.</q>
          <p>
            Or when she needed me to do something, ie. get ready for
            kindergarten or put on pants:
          </p>
          <q>I ask computer … computer says no.</q>
          <q>Not right now, am on screen saver. Try again later.</q>
          <p>
            Kindergarten teachers have heard me tell other kids to
            <q>turn TOY_NAME off and on again.</q> when toys were broken.

          <p>The obvious takeaway from this is:</p>
