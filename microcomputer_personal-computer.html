        <h3>The software operating system</h3>
          <p class="headline-sub">
          A contender to the microcomputer was IBM's so-called Personal Computer
          or PC although it was much pricier and did not find its way into
          normal homes straight away.
          </p>
          <p>
          Much began to change as the new IBM PC (PC
          for Personal Computer) entered the market. The IBM PC used a software
          operating system. This had to load on startup but made it easier to
          update - simply because you did not need to buy a completely new piece
          of hardware. The OS (for Operating System) was called MSDOS, this was
          short for Micro-Soft Disk Operating System (yes, they used a dash in
          their name in the early days). The code was based on the UNIX
          operating system although greatly simplified.

          I can't remember a time where I didn't have a computer in my home -
            I can't even remember a time where I didn't have a
            computer/phone/gameboy on my person at all times, so I had to call
            up my mom to help. My family got our first PC in 1997, when I was
            3-years old. It was an IBM 340 - one of the first “budget”-models -
            and it probably saved my mom from endless hours of handwriting
            assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
            My mom had the policy of always answering questions truthfully (no
            santa-lies here), so when 3-year-old me asked her what the big grey
            box on the desk was, she told me. That was a big mistake. Little did
            she know, that 3-year-old me had just discovered back-talk and that
            I was just about to develop a yet unforeseen level of sass and
            attitude.

            After surviving the inquisition of a toddler and being proud she
            fulfilled her motherly duties and broadened my horizon, she thought
            everything would go on as normal. Oh boy was she wrong. Afterwards
            when she asked 3-year-old me where something was I would respond
            with phrases like:
          </p>
          <q>I'll check the hard drive … hard drive is deleted.</q>
          <p>
            Or when she needed me to do something, ie. get ready for
            kindergarten or put on pants:
          </p>
          <q>I ask computer … computer says no.</q>
          <q>Not right now, am on screen saver. Try again later.</q>
          <p>
            Kindergarten teachers have heard me tell other kids to <q>turn
            TOY_NAME off and on again.</q>  
            
          </p>
          <p>The obvious takeaway from this is 
            <ol>
              <li>
                I've
                always been a sass-machine
              </li>
              <li>
                Never give a toddler knowledge you don't
            want thrown right back at you.
