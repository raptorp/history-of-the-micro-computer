            Featured on the cover of the magazine
            <cite>Popular Electronics</cite> in January 1975 was the
            <cite>MITS Altair 8800</cite> and this started the new era of the
            microcomputer. Limited as it were, it was still widely popular -
            though mainly amongst geeks. The MITS could be purchased as a DIY
            project, and when it was assembled it had eight switches that could
            be used to program it. Each switch represented one bit in the memory
            register and instructions were made one byte at a time.

            The word "<dfn>geek</dfn>" originally (in the 16th century) meant a
            freak (from Dutch "<i>gek</i>" or Low German "<i>geck</i>"), but
            from 1983 it has been recorded in teenage slang as referring to
            peers with few social skills but a keen interest in new technology.

              As the microcomputers developed and became more advanced, they
              would have more memory and a built-in keyboard. They would also
              come with some sort of text-based interface - typically a specific
              flavour of a programming language like <cite>Basic</cite> or
              something similar.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most well-known microcomputers was the
              <cite>ZX81</cite>, which came out in 1981. This computer had a
              wide appeal even though it had no more than 1 Kb of RAM. Later
              extension modules became available so that you could upgrade to
              either 16 or 64 Kb. With so much RAM you could type in 64.000
              characters of computer code.

          <section class="column-txt column-right">
            <p>
              The <cite>ZX81</cite> was followed by the
              <cite>ZX Spectrum</cite> in 1982. This one came with 16 Kb but
              could be upgraded to 128 Kb. To use it, one would have to connect
              it to a television set and the resolution you'd see would be 256 x
              192 pixels, which is equal to 32 characters across in 24 lines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Within the next couple of years, a myriad of microcomputers hit
              the market. They were now becoming known as
              <em>home computers</em> and they include machines from well-known
              brands like <cite>Acorn</cite>, <cite>Amstrad</cite>,
              <cite>Atari</cite>, <cite>Commodore</cite>, <cite>Texas</cite> and
              <cite>Sinclair</cite>. Two brands ended up stealing the scene -
              and the market: <cite>IBM</cite> and <cite>Apple</cite>.

          Computers continued to develop. In the microcomputer age, the computer
          was mostly used as a very specialised machine. In many cases, it was a
          toy used for gaming or a little bit of home programming. Later that
          changed, as the internet developed and people began to connect. In the
          words of Bill Gates, the founder of <cite>Microsoft</cite> and the
          developer of <cite>MSDOS</cite> :
          <q>
            I think it's fair to say that personal computers have become the
            most empowering tool we've ever created. They're tools of
            communication, they're tools of creativity, and they can be shaped
            by their user.
