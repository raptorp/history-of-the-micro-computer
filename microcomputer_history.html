          <h3>The first popular microcomputer</h3>
          <aside class="headline-sub">
            A microcomputer is defined as a computer with a single central
            processing unit (CPU) as a microprocessor.

            Featured on the cover of the magazine Popular Electronics in January
            1975 was the MITS Altair 8800 and this started the new era of the
            microcomputer. Limited as it were, it was still widely popular -
            though mainly amongst geeks. The MITS could be purchased as a DIY
            project, and when it was assembled it had eight switches that could
            be used to program it. Each switch represented one bit in the memory
            register and instructions were made one byte at a time.

            The word “geek” originally (in the 16th century) meant a freak (from
            Dutch “gek” or Low German “geck”), but from 1983 it has been
            recorded in teenage slang as referring to peers with few social
            skills but a keen interest in new technology.

              As the microcomputers developed and became more advanced, they
              would have more memory and a built-in keyboard. They would also
              come with some sort of text-based interface – typically a specific
              flavour of a programming language like Basic or something similar.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most well-known microcomputers was the ZX81, which came
              out in 1981. This computer had a wide appeal even though it had no
              more than 1 Kb of RAM. Later extension modules became available so
              that you could upgrade to either 16 or 64 Kb. With so much RAM you
              could type in 64.000 characters of computer code.

              The ZX81 was followed by the ZX Spectrum in 1982. This one came
              with 16 Kb but could be upgraded to 128 Kb. To use it, one would
              have to connect it to a television set and the resolution you’d
              see would be 256 x 192 pixels, which is equal to 32 characters
              across in 24 lines.

            <p>
              Within the next couple of years, a myriad of microcomputers hit
              the market. They were now becoming known as home computers and
              they include machines from well-known brands like Acorn, Amstrad,
              Atari, Commodore, Texas and Sinclair. Two brands ended up stealing
              the scene - and the market: IBM and Apple.

          Computers continued to develop. In the microcomputer age, the computer
          was mostly used as a very specialised machine. In many cases, it was a
          toy used for gaming or a little bit of home programming. Later that
          changed, as the internet developed and people began to connect. In the
          words of Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft and the developer of
          MSDOS: “I think it's fair to say that personal computers have become
          the most empowering tool we've ever created. They're tools of
          communication, they're tools of creativity, and they can be shaped by
          their user.”
