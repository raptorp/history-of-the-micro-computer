      <h3>How to use a microcomputer</h3>

      <p>
        The most successful microcomputer by far was the Commodore 64. It had an
        8-bit microprocessor with a clock frequency of just about 1 megahertz
        and 64 Kb of RAM. The extraordinary thing about the C64 though was it’s
        extra graphics chip which was able to show 16 colours, 8 sprites, had
        scrolling capabilities and a resolution of 320x200 pixels (40x25
        characters) and its sound chip that could play 8 octaves of sound in 3
        channels. The multimedia race had begun (although no one used that word
        yet).
      </p>

      <p>
        The C64 was a keyboard with a computer inside, like most other home
        computers. It had several connections on the back through which you
        could connect other types of hardware like joysticks, midi instruments,
        an external storage device or a television set.
      </p>

      <p>
        The C64 was a plug-and-play (no one used that word either). When you
        turned it on, the cursor was immediately blinking ready to take
        commands. The interface was text-based and the programming language was
        Commodore Basic. Anything you wrote would be executed straight away
        unless you put it into a program. You created programs by adding line
        numbers in front of your command. This program was written line by line
        (not necessarily in the right order) and stored in the computer's RAM.
        If you turned the computer off, your work would be lost unless you had
        stored it on an external storage device.
      </p>

      <p>
        Disk drives were for the most part too expensive and a special cassette
        drive was used as a data storage device.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the program was ready you could run it by typing the command RUN
        followed by tapping the Return key.
      </p>

      <p>
        The computer mouse had been invented, but most people had not seen or
        even heard of it. So to open up a program on a Commodore 64, one would
        have to write directly to the screen (which was effectively a prompt or
        a terminal):
      </p>

      <blockquote class="quote-c64">LOAD “PROGRAM_NAME”,8.</blockquote>

      <p>
        The number would be the device to connect with. The Commodore would
        respond with the following lines:
      </p>

      <blockquote class="quote-c64">
        SEARCHING FOR “PROGRAM_NAME” <br />
        LOADING <br />
        READY.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The program would now be loaded into the Commodore’s memory. You could
        have a look at the program by writing the command LIST or you could
        start the execution of the program with RUN.
      </p>

      <h3>The software was the edge</h3>

      <p>
        In the time of the microcomputer software was written specifically for
        each computer, as they each came with their operating system built into
        them. Burned into their microchips were the commands that they
        understood, and programmers needed to write their programs to the
        specific machine. The amount of software available for a specific
        computer played a significant role in its success.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is one of the reasons for the huge success of the Commodore 64.
        With its powerful graphics and sound processors, it was a perfect
        platform for games and it gave programmers a strong platform to develop
        all sorts. Of the more famous ones, one could mention Archon: The Light
        and the Dark (1983) – A mythical battle chess, Impossible Mission (1984)
        - A platform action game, Pitstop II (1984) – A car race simulation,
        Elite (1985) – A space simulation game, Leaderboard Golf (1986) – A
        sports simulation, IK+ (1987) – A fighting game, InternationalSoccer
        (1988) – A soccer simulation, Grand Prix Circuit (1989) – Formula One,
        Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday (1990) – an adventure/RPG, Creatures
        2: Torture Trouble (1992) – Platform type and Mayhem in Monsterland
        (1993) – A platform type.
