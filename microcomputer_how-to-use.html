          <h3>The Commodore 64</h3>

          <p class="headline-sub">
            The most successful microcomputer by far was the
            <cite>Commodore 64</cite>. It had an 8-bit microprocessor with a
            clock frequency of just about 1 megahertz and 64 Kb of RAM.
          </p>
          <p>
            The extraordinary thing about the
            <abbr title="Commodore 64">C64</abbr> though was it's extra graphics
            chip which was able to show 16 colours, 8 sprites, had scrolling
            capabilities and a resolution of 320x200 pixels (40x25 characters)
            and its sound chip that could play 8 octaves of sound in 3 channels.
            The C64 was a keyboard with a computer inside, like most other home
            computers. It had several connections on the back through which you
            could connect other types of hardware like joysticks, midi
            instruments, an external storage device or a television set.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <cite>C64</cite> was a plug-and-play. When you turned it on, the
            cursor was immediately blinking ready to take commands. The
            interface was text-based and the programming language was
            <cite>Commodore Basic</cite>. Anything you wrote would be executed
            straight away unless you put it into a program. You created programs
            by adding line numbers in front of your command. This program was
            written line by line (not necessarily in the right order) and stored
            in the computer's RAM. If you turned the computer off, your work
            would be lost unless you had stored it on an external storage
            device.

            The computer mouse had been invented, but most people had not seen
            or even heard of it. So to open up a program on a
            <cite>Commodore 64</cite>, one would have to write directly to the
            screen (which was effectively a prompt or a terminal):
          </p>
          <figure>
            <blockquote class="quote-c64">
              <i>LOAD “PROGRAM_NAME”,8.</i>
            </blockquote>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The number would be the device to connect with. The Commodore would
            respond with the following lines:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <blockquote class="quote-c64">
              SEARCHING FOR “PROGRAM_NAME” <br />
              LOADING <br />
              READY.
            </blockquote>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The program would now be loaded into the Commodore’s memory. You
            could have a look at the program by writing the command LIST or you
            could start the execution of the program with RUN.

          <p>
            When the program was ready you could run it by typing the command
            RUN followed by tapping the Return key.

        <h3>The software was the edge</h3>

        <p>
          In the time of the microcomputer software was written specifically for
          each computer, as they each came with their operating system built
          into them. Burned into their microchips were the commands that they
          understood, and programmers needed to write their programs to the
          specific machine. The amount of software available for a specific
          computer played a significant role in its success.
          <br />
          This is one of the reasons for the huge success of the
          <cite>Commodore 64</cite>. With its powerful graphics and sound
          processors, it was a perfect platform for games and it gave
          programmers a strong platform to develop all sorts. Of the more famous
          ones, one could mention
