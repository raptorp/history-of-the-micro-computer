      <h1>The History of the Microcomputer</h1>
      <h3>The microcomputer</h3>

      <p>
        The first computers made were big. “Room”-size big. They were also very
        expensive and pretty slow and you had to be a specialist to program
        them. So the president of IBM, Thomas Watson, can be forgiven for his
        infamous quote from 1943:
        <q>I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.</q>
