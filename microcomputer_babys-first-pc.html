      <h3>The software operating system</h3>

      <p>
        A contender to the microcomputer was IBMâ€™s so-called Personal Computer
        or PC although it was much pricier and did not find its way into normal
        homes straight away. Much began to change as the new IBM PC (PC for
        Personal Computer) entered the market. The IBM PC used a software
        operating system. This had to load on startup but made it easier to
        update - simply because you did not need to buy a completely new piece
        of hardware. The OS (for Operating System) was called MSDOS, this was
        short for Micro-Soft Disk Operating System (yes, they used a dash in
        their name in the early days). The code was based on the UNIX operating
        system although greatly simplified.
